        A demo site for the Rosey-CloudCannon Multilingual Connector for
        Astro.


        This content and it's translations are editable from the visual
        editor, as well as data files, providing an easy to use interface for
        non-technical people to maintain a multilingual site.


        This is **new** and should *now* work.

        They say *everything* looks better with odd numbers of things. But
        sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics.


        That is when you can experience **true** **joy**, when you have no
        fear. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here.


        It's cold, but it's beautiful. Get tough with it, get strong. Brown is
        such a nice color.
